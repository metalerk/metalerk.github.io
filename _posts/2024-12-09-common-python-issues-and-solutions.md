# Most Common Python Issues on StackOverflow and How to Solve Them

Python is one of the most popular programming languages, widely loved for its simplicity and versatility. However, even experienced developers run into issues. This blog post discusses some of the most common Python problems posted on StackOverflow and provides solutions to help you avoid or resolve them.

---

## 1. **`TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable`**

**Problem:**  
This error occurs when trying to iterate over an integer instead of an iterable like a list or a string.

**Example Code:**

<pre><code class="language-python">
number = 5
for i in number:
    print(i)
</code></pre>

**Solution:**  
Ensure you are iterating over an iterable object like a list, range, or string.

**Correct Code:**
<pre><code class="language-python">
number = 5
for i in range(number):
    print(i)
</code></pre>

## 2. **`IndentationError: unexpected indent`**

**Problem:**  
This error is caused by inconsistent use of tabs and spaces for indentation.

**Example Code:**
<pre><code class="language-python">
def my_function():
    print("Hello World!")
        print("This will cause an IndentationError")
</code></pre>

**Solution:**  
Stick to either spaces or tabs for indentation and be consistent throughout your code.

**Correct Code:**
<pre><code class="language-python">
def my_function():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("This will work correctly!")
</code></pre>

## 3. **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_name'`**

**Problem:**  
This error occurs when Python cannot find the specified module.

**Solution:**  
1. Ensure the module is installed. Use `pip install module_name` to install it.
2. Verify the module name is correct.
3. Check your virtual environment settings.

**Example Command:**  
``pip install numpy``

## 4. **`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'attribute_name'`**

**Problem:**  
This happens when you try to access an attribute of an object that is `None`.

**Example Code:**
<pre><code class="language-python">
result = my_function()
print(result.attribute)
</code></pre>

**Solution:**  
Always validate objects before accessing their attributes.

**Correct Code:**
<pre><code class="language-python">
result = my_function()
if result is not None:
    print(result.attribute)
</code></pre>

These are just a few common Python issues. Addressing them effectively can save you hours of debugging and frustration. Happy coding!
