## 3. The Origin of the Universe

The Big Bang theory explains the universe's beginning, but questions remain about what existed before and what triggered the event.

### Fascinating Questions:
- What caused the Big Bang?
- Is there evidence of a multiverse?

## 5. The Fate of the Universe

How will the universe end? Theories range from the "Big Freeze," where the universe cools to a halt, to the "Big Crunch," where it collapses back on itself.

### Theories:
- Will the universe expand forever?
- Could a new Big Bang occur?
