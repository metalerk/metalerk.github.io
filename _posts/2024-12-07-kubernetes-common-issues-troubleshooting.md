Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform, but troubleshooting issues can be challenging, especially for beginners. This guide covers some of the most common Kubernetes problems and how to resolve them.

---

## 1. **Pod Stuck in Pending State**

### Problem:
A pod is stuck in the `Pending` state and does not progress to `Running`.

### Common Causes:
- Insufficient resources (CPU or memory) in the cluster.
- Node selectors or taints preventing scheduling.
- Missing PersistentVolume for PersistentVolumeClaim.

### Solution:
1. Check the pod's events for more information:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    ```

2. Verify cluster resources:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```

3. Ensure the PVC is bound (if used):
    ```bash
    kubectl get pvc
    ```

## 2. **CrashLoopBackOff**

### Problem:
A pod is continuously restarting due to the `CrashLoopBackOff` error.

### Common Causes:
- Application inside the container is crashing.
- Misconfigured environment variables or secrets.
- Missing or incorrect dependencies.

### Solution:
1. Inspect the pod logs:
    ```bash
    kubectl logs <pod-name>
    ```

2. Check the pod's events:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    ```

3. Debug interactively:
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
    ```

## 3. **ImagePullBackOff**

### Problem:
A pod fails to start because Kubernetes cannot pull the container image.

### Common Causes:
- Incorrect image name or tag.
- Missing credentials for private registries.
- Network issues preventing image pulling.

### Solution:
1. Verify the image name and tag:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    ```

2. Check the image registry URL and credentials:
    ```yaml
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: <secret-name>
    ```

3. Test connectivity to the registry:
    ```bash
    curl -v <registry-url>
    ```

---

## 4. **Service Not Accessible**

### Problem:
A Kubernetes service is not reachable from outside the cluster.

### Common Causes:
- Misconfigured `Service` type.
- Incorrect ingress or firewall rules.
- Pods backing the service are not ready.

### Solution:
1. Verify the service configuration:
    ```bash
kubectl describe service <service-name>
    ```

2. Check the endpoints:
    ```bash
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
    ```

3. Debug network connectivity:
    ```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name>\
-- curl <service-name>:<port>
    ```

---

## 5. **Node Not Ready**

### Problem:
One or more nodes are marked as `NotReady`.

### Common Causes:
- Node is under resource pressure.
- Kubernetes components (kubelet, container runtime) are not running.
- Network connectivity issues.

### Solution:
1. Check the node's status:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe node <node-name>
    ```

2. SSH into the node and check the kubelet logs:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u kubelet -f
    ```

3. Restart the kubelet if needed:
    ```bash
    systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

## Conclusion

Kubernetes troubleshooting requires a systematic approach. Use the `kubectl` command to inspect resources, logs, and events. With practice, resolving common Kubernetes issues will become second nature. Happy debugging!
