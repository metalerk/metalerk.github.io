Docker has become an essential tool in modern software development, but users often encounter challenging issues in real-world scenarios. This guide presents practical cases of common Docker problems and provides detailed solutions.

## 1. Case: Container Crashes on Startup

### Scenario
A developer pulls an official MySQL image and tries to start a container using the following command:

   `docker run --name mydb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d mysql:latest`

However, the container keeps restarting.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Inspect Logs**:
   
   `docker logs mydb`
   
   Example output:
   
   `[ERROR] --initialize specified but the data directory has files in it.`

2. **Identify the Problem**:

   The issue occurs because a volume is mapped to the container's data directory (`/var/lib/mysql`), and it already contains files incompatible with MySQL initialization.

3. **Solution**:

   Remove the existing volume or ensure it's compatible:

     `docker volume rm <volume_name>`

## 2. Case: High Disk Usage from Docker Resources

### Scenario
A team notices the server running Docker is running out of disk space. Upon investigation, they find that Docker is consuming significant storage.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Inspect Disk Usage**:
   
   `docker system df`

   Example output:
   
   </code></pre>
   TYPE          TOTAL     ACTIVE      SIZE
   Images        15        5          5.6GB
   Containers    10        2          1.3GB
   </code></pre>
2. **Remove Unused Resources**:
   
   - Prune unused images, containers, and volumes:
   
     `docker system prune -a`

3. **Automate Cleanup**:
   
   - Add a cron job to periodically clean up unused resources.

## 3. Case: Container Cannot Access the Internet

### Scenario

A developer runs a container, but it cannot reach external websites or APIs.

`docker run --name webapp -d mywebapp:latest`

The container's application throws DNS resolution errors.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Test Connectivity**:

   - Exec into the container and check network access:

     `docker exec -it webapp ping google.com`

2. **Check Docker DNS Configuration**:

   - Inspect the Docker network configuration:

     `docker network inspect bridge`

3. **Fix DNS Issues**:
   
   - Manually specify DNS servers when starting the container:
   
     `docker run --name webapp --dns 8.8.8.8 -d mywebapp:latest`

## 4. Case: Slow Docker Builds

### Scenario

A team experiences long build times when building a large application with a Dockerfile containing many steps.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Analyze Build Logs**:

   - Use the `--progress=plain` flag to understand which step takes the most time:

     `docker build --progress=plain -t myapp .`

2. **Optimize Dockerfile**:
   
   - Reorder steps to cache layers effectively:
   
     ```dockerfile
     FROM python:3.9-slim
     COPY requirements.txt /app/
     RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
     COPY . /app/
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```
3. **Use Multistage Builds**:
   
   - Reduce image size by separating build and runtime dependencies.

## 5. Case: Port Binding Failure

### Scenario
A developer tries to run an NGINX container on port 80:

`docker run -p 80:80 nginx`

The command fails with the error:

`Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use`

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Active Processes**:

   Identify which process is using the port:

     `sudo netstat -tuln | grep 80`

2. **Kill the Process**:

   `sudo kill <pid>`

3. **Run the Container on a Different Port**:
   
   Use a non-conflicting port:
   
     `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx`
